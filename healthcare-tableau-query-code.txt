/*
Objectives
Come up with flu shots dashboard for 2022 that does the following

1.) Total % of patients getting flu shots stratified by
	a.) Age
	b.) Race
	c.) County (On a Map)
	d.) Overall
2.) Running Total of Flu Shots over the course of 2022
3.) Total number of Flu shots given in 2022
4.) A list of patients that show whether or not they received the flu shots

Requirements:

Patients must have been "Active at our hospital"
*/

-- common table expression to get all patients and the earliest date at which they got the flu shot
-- this will help us reduce duplicates by forcing a 1:1 relationship when we perform a join

with flu_shot_2022 as
(
select patient, min(date) as earliest_flu_shot_2022
from immunizations
where code = '5302'
  and date between '2022-01-01 00:00' and '2022-12-31 23:59'
group by patient
),

-- CTE to define the period where patients are active, this gets rid of any long deceased/inactive patients 

active_patients as
(
	select distinct patient
	from encounters as e
	join patients as pat
	  on e.patient = pat.id
	where start between '2020-01-01 00:00' and '2022-12-31 23:59'
	  and pat.deathdate is null
	  and extract(month from age('2022-12-31',pat.birthdate)) >= 6 -- patient must be older than 6 months to receive flu shot
)

select pat.birthplace
	,pat.race
	,pat.county

	,pat.first
	,pat.last

	,extract(YEAR FROM age('12-31-2022', pat.birthdate)) as age
	,case when flu.patient is not null then 1
	 else 0
	 end as flu_shot_2022
from patients as pat
left join flu_shot_2022 as flu -- left join our CTE so we get both patients who did and did not receive a flu shot
  on pat.id = flu.patient
where 1=1
and pat.id in (select patient from active_patients) -- subquery referencing our CTE for active patients
