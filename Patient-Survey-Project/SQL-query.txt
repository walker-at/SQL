-- im using a cte because
-- we are getting the number of beds to later classify hospitals as small, medium, and large
-- some hospitals have multiple dates wehre they reported the number of beds so we want to find the number of beds at the latest date
-- wrap it in a create table statement before exporitng to tableau

create table "postgres"."Hospital_Data".tableau_file as

with hospital_beds_prep as
(
select lpad(cast(provider_ccn as text),6,'0') as provider_ccn  -- hospital provider ccn number should be 6 characters but some initial 0's got cut off so we add them back here.

      ,to_date(fiscal_year_end_date, 'MM/DD/YYYY') as fiscal_year_end_date
      ,number_of_beds
      ,row number() over(partition by provider_ccn orer by to_date(fiscal_year_end_date, 'MM/DD/YYYY') desc) as nth_row  -- assigns number 1 to most recent bed count report
from "postgres"."Hospital_Data".hospital_beds

left join hospital_beds_prep as beds
