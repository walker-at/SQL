This repository contains the SQL code used to setup my HCAHPS Patient Survey visualization using Tableau. This project can be viewed at: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/walker.atterbury/viz/HealthcareSystemFluShots2022_17122423417820/Dashboard1#1

Problem Statement:
Visualize the performance of hospitals on the HCAHPS. The Hospital Value Base Pruchasing Program is one program introduced after the Affordable Care Act (2010). The gist of the Value Based Purchasing Program is that hospitals have their payments adjusted based off the quality of the care they provide each year. This is assessed in 4 domains. The domain relevant to this project is the Person and Community Engagement Domain, which is measured by the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS): a standardized, publicly-reported survey of patients' perspectives of hospital care. 

Question Examples with answers ranging from "Never" to "Always", or 1-10: 

* "Was the hospital quiet at night and clean?"

* "Did doctors and nurses always coomunicate with you well?"

With this dashboard, you can filter by hospital size and location state to examine the percentage of patients that scored the selected hospital a 9 or 10 out of 10. It also tracks the survey response rate as well as the total number of surveys completed per hospital in 2022. Finally, it visualizes how the selected hospital performed in comparison to other hospitals in its size cohort. This project provides a holistic view of HCAHPS performance, empowering informed decision-making and efficient hospital management.
