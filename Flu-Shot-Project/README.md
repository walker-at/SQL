This repository contains the SQL code used to setup my Healthcare Flu Shot visualization using Tableau. This project can be viewed at: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/walker.atterbury/viz/HealthcareSystemFluShots2022_17122423417820/Dashboard1#1

With this dashboard, you can examine the percentage of patients receiving flu shots categorized by age, race, and county (displayed on an interactive map) in Massachussetts for a phony healthcare provider. It also tracks the running total of flu shots administered throughout the year. This project provides a holistic view of flu shot distribution and patient vaccination statuses, empowering informed decision-making and efficient patient management.
